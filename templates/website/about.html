    <p>Emati is a recommender system for scientific literature. From your
    interactions we learn which topics you like and which you don't. Using
    this information we rank the latest articles according to your interests.
    New content is generated every sunday night. So check back Monday morning
    to see what's new. Currently all papers are sourced from 
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank">PubMed</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>.
    The range of topics is therefore limited to those also present there.
    </p>

    <p>Emati is developed by TU Dresden (Germany). The project is the result of
    combined efforts of Kurt Lachmann, Richard Kwasnicki, Joschka Heinrich, Ã–zge Kart,
    Alexandre Mestiashvili and Michael Schroeder.</p>
